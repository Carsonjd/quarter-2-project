# Quarter Two Project: [*CloudVU*](http://cloudvu.herokuapp.com/)
## Stephanie Marvez, Judah Trimmer, Patrick Glynn, Jonathan Carson

Through the use of Postgres, D3 and Mapbox we have created an app with which
a user can save locations chosen from a map in order to quickly and easy view
weather data visualization for a spot forecast. A user can choose a location
either through geocoding search, geolocation, or simply scrolling and
clicking/tapping on the map itself. The location will be saved with
longitude and latitude information along with a custom name set by the user.
The map can be used to access weather data without logging in, but once logged
in, a user can recall saved locations and view the forecast without navigating
on the map. The weather data is visualized with a D3 stream graph so that the
user can see trends in the forthcoming weather and easily see what is happening.
